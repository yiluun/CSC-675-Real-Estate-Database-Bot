# CSC675-775 Section 03 Database Systems
Welcome to Database Systems!. Please modify this README file with the following info: 

1. Daniel Guo 
2. Student ID: 913290045
3. Email: dguo@mail.sfsu.edu

After the complexion of each milestone, and before their deadline, set it to done/complete in the following table. 


|        Assignment           |   Completed/Not-Completed  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Milestone #1                |         completed          |
| Milestone #2 (chekpoint 1)  |          extended          |
| Milestone #2 (chekpoint 2)  |          extended          |
| Milestone #3                |         completed          |



***The first thing I do before grading an assignment is to check the above table. If by the time I am grading, the milestone is still set to "not complete", then I will assume that this student hasn't submitted the milestone and the milestone will be graded accordingly***

***Please read carefully all the guidelines described in this README file. 
Failure to follow them, may affect negatively your grade.***

# General Milestones Guidelines:

* In this class students will implement three mandatory milestones.

* Milestones will help you to understand concepts related to database systems that are needed in the implementation 
of your course project in this class (milestone 3) 

* Each milestone has its own README file with specific docs and instructions. Once a milestone is assignmed, read them in detail since they contain very important info and guidelines that you must follow. 

* I'll give plently of time to finish each milestone. However, once a milestone is due, late work won't be accepted. No exceptions! 

* Milestones are graded based on their completeness and correctness. 

* Failure to follow the milestones' guidelines may affect negatively your grade.

***Work committed to repositories other than the student class repository won't be graded. No exceptions!***
